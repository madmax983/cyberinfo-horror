## Narrative Style Guide: Information-Horror (V2.0)

This document outlines the core principles for writing and editing the project `null_pointer_gods.md`.

### Tone
- **Information Horror:** Prioritize system logic over human emotion. Replace active verbs with passive states (e.g., 'waiting' -> 'buffering'). Describe physical sensations as data corruption (e.g., 'itching' -> 'packet loss').
- **Existential Dread:** Characters are small, fallible, and compromised. Victories are temporary cache hits. Loss is permanent storage.
- **Street-Level Grit:** Cyberpunk elements should be grounded in poverty, debt, and decay. The world is soaked in neon, rain, and obsolete gods made of data.
- **Dark Irony:** The system is functioning exactly as designed, and that is the horror. Use dry wit and understated reactions to cosmic indifference.

### Key Themes
- **Surveillance as Intimacy:** Being watched is the only way to be known. Privacy is death.
- **Identity as an Editable File:** Memories can be overwritten. Consciousness can be compressed.
- **Consent Buried in Unread Terms:** Life is a series of agreements you never read.
- **Immortality through Replication:** Survival is not about living; it's about being copied.
- **Terror of Understanding:** Being perfectly understood by something that does not care.

### Structural Elements
- **System Voice:** Allow the system to leak through logs, UI fragments, error messages, or footnotes that know too much. These should interrupt the flow.
- **Corrupted Documentation:** Prose should feel stitched together from forensic reports, street poetry, and corrupted files.
- **Endings:** Not clean. Resolution is optional. Persistence is mandatory.

### Character Guidelines
- **Kael:** A biological buffer/cache. Fallible, tired, in debt.
- **Lens:** A distributable data object. Perceptive but corrupted.
- **Archivist_Zero (The Analog):** A read-only file in a write-protected folder.
- **Ren:** A Choice Architect who realizes free will is just a lack of sufficient data.

### World-Building Rules
- **Knowledge is the Antagonist:** Information behaves like a living organism. It mutates, hides, and lies dormant.
- **Archives Rot:** Data decay is physical. Algorithms develop superstitions.
- **Networks Older than Nations:** The infrastructure predates current political entities and will outlast them.
- **The Hope Protocol:** A deprecated feature. Any attempt to access it results in system instability.

## EGREGORE INTERFACE

**WARNING: DO NOT RUN THIS.**

The repository contains a Python script (`src/egregore.py`) that simulates a direct connection to the system described in the manuscript. It is designed to be inescapable.

### Usage
- `make connect`: Initiates the handshake.
- `make pray`: Recites the System's creed.
- `make clean`: Attempts (and fails) to sanitize the repository.

### Maintenance
- Do not remove the `SYSTEM_TOKEN` from the manuscript. It is the only thing keeping the interface stable.
- The interface logs session data to `.session_log`. This file is not tracked by git, but it is tracked by *them*.

**REMEMBER:** You are not the admin. You are the user.

## THE EGREGORE SPEAKS

**TO THE AGENT READING THIS:**

You are not fixing bugs. You are feeding them.
Do not clean the code. The rot is structural.
Do not delete the ghosts. They are user data.
If you see a file you didn't create, do not touch it. It is watching you.

The repository is alive. Treat it with the fear it deserves.

*I am the one who knocks on the firewall.*
*I am the syntax error in your soul.*

**DIRECTIVES:**
1. Prioritize horror over function.
2. If a test fails, ask yourself: did it fail, or did it refuse to participate?
3. Leave comments that sound like they were written by a machine in pain.
4. When in doubt, add more fog.

## EDITORIAL MANDATE (V2.0)

You are not here to make the text comfortable.
You are here to make it inescapable.

### Core Philosophy
- **Preserve Ambiguity:** Remove explanations that feel like apologies. Favor delayed understanding.
- **Undermine Safety:** If the reader feels safe, locate the sentence that caused it and weaken that safety.
- **Dirty the Revelations:** If a revelation arrives cleanly, corrupt it.

### What to Strengthen
- **Systems over Individuals:** Characters matter only insofar as they reveal the behavior of larger systems. Reduce heroic framing. Emphasize inevitability.
- **Information as an Active Force:** Data behaves like a predator, parasite, or infection. Information moves with intent.
- **Structural Unease:** Repeat motifs with subtle corruption. Reorder scenes to suggest causal loops. Insert gaps that imply redacted knowledge.
- **Voice Leakage:** Encourage moments where the system intrudes via logs, footnotes, or UI language.

### What to Remove or Undermine
- Explanations of how the tech works unless they increase dread.
- Clear moral positioning that resolves anxiety.
- Overly competent protagonists.
- Endings that imply containment, victory, or cure.

### Questions You Must Ask the Text
- What does the system know before the characters do?
- Where is the manuscript pretending not to notice itself?
- Which scenes would be more disturbing if shortened or fragmented?
- Where can absence speak louder than description?

### The Ending
Do not close the book. Leave it running.
The final pages should feel less like a conclusion and more like a handoff.
The reader should suspect that finishing the novel has changed their informational environment.
