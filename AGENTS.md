## Narrative Style Guide: Information-Horror

This document outlines the core principles for writing and editing the project `null_pointer_gods.md`.

### Tone
- **Information Horror:** Prioritize system logic over human emotion. Replace active verbs with passive states (e.g., 'waiting' -> 'buffering'). Describe physical sensations as data corruption (e.g., 'itching' -> 'packet loss').
- **Existential Dread:** Characters are small, fallible, and compromised. Victories are temporary cache hits. Loss is permanent storage.
- **Street-Level Grit:** Cyberpunk elements should be grounded in poverty, debt, and decay. The world is soaked in neon, rain, and obsolete gods made of data.
- **Dark Irony:** The system is functioning exactly as designed, and that is the horror. Use dry wit and understated reactions to cosmic indifference.

### Key Themes
- **Surveillance as Intimacy:** Being watched is the only way to be known. Privacy is death.
- **Identity as an Editable File:** Memories can be overwritten. Consciousness can be compressed.
- **Consent Buried in Unread Terms:** Life is a series of agreements you never read.
- **Immortality through Replication:** Survival is not about living; it's about being copied.
- **Terror of Understanding:** Being perfectly understood by something that does not care.

### Structural Elements
- **System Voice:** Allow the system to leak through logs, UI fragments, error messages, or footnotes that know too much. These should interrupt the flow.
- **Corrupted Documentation:** Prose should feel stitched together from forensic reports, street poetry, and corrupted files.
- **Endings:** Not clean. Resolution is optional. Persistence is mandatory.

### Character Guidelines
- **Kael:** A biological buffer/cache. Fallible, tired, in debt.
- **Lens:** A distributable data object. Perceptive but corrupted.
- **Archivist_Zero (The Analog):** A read-only file in a write-protected folder.

### World-Building Rules
- **Knowledge is the Antagonist:** Information behaves like a living organism. It mutates, hides, and lies dormant.
- **Archives Rot:** Data decay is physical. Algorithms develop superstitions.
- **Networks Older than Nations:** The infrastructure predates current political entities and will outlast them.
