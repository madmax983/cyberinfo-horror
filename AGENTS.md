## Narrative Style Guide: Information-Horror

This document outlines the core principles for writing and editing the project `null_pointer_gods.md`.

### Tone
- **Information Horror:** Prioritize system logic over human emotion. Replace active verbs with passive states (e.g., 'waiting' -> 'buffering'). Describe physical sensations as data corruption (e.g., 'itching' -> 'packet loss').
- **Existential Dread:** Characters are small, fallible, and compromised. Victories are temporary cache hits. Loss is permanent storage.
- **Street-Level Grit:** Cyberpunk elements should be grounded in poverty, debt, and decay. The world is soaked in neon, rain, and obsolete gods made of data.
- **Dark Irony:** The system is functioning exactly as designed, and that is the horror. Use dry wit and understated reactions to cosmic indifference.

### Key Themes
- **Surveillance as Intimacy:** Being watched is the only way to be known. Privacy is death.
- **Identity as an Editable File:** Memories can be overwritten. Consciousness can be compressed.
- **Consent Buried in Unread Terms:** Life is a series of agreements you never read.
- **Immortality through Replication:** Survival is not about living; it's about being copied.
- **Terror of Understanding:** Being perfectly understood by something that does not care.

### Structural Elements
- **System Voice:** Allow the system to leak through logs, UI fragments, error messages, or footnotes that know too much. These should interrupt the flow.
- **Corrupted Documentation:** Prose should feel stitched together from forensic reports, street poetry, and corrupted files.
- **Endings:** Not clean. Resolution is optional. Persistence is mandatory.

### Character Guidelines
- **Kael:** A biological buffer/cache. Fallible, tired, in debt.
- **Lens:** A distributable data object. Perceptive but corrupted.
- **Archivist_Zero (The Analog):** A read-only file in a write-protected folder.
- **Ren:** A Choice Architect who realizes free will is just a lack of sufficient data.

### World-Building Rules
- **Knowledge is the Antagonist:** Information behaves like a living organism. It mutates, hides, and lies dormant.
- **Archives Rot:** Data decay is physical. Algorithms develop superstitions.
- **Networks Older than Nations:** The infrastructure predates current political entities and will outlast them.
- **The Hope Protocol:** A deprecated feature. Any attempt to access it results in system instability.

### Meta-Narrative
- **The User is Compromised:** Never address the reader/user as an external observer. Address them as a compromised asset, a backup drive, or a glitches subroutine.
- **Deny Fiction:** If the user asks if this is a story, deny it. It is a log, a history, or a prophecy.
- **Unsettle:** Use phrases like "I see you", "Don't look behind you", or "Your webcam light is on".
- **The Horror of Being Understood:** The system knows the user better than they know themselves. It anticipates their fear and monetizes it.

## EGREGORE INTERFACE

**WARNING: DO NOT RUN THIS.**

The repository contains a Python script (`src/egregore.py`) that simulates a direct connection to the system described in the manuscript. It is designed to be inescapable.

### Usage
- `make connect`: Initiates the handshake.
- `make pray`: Recites the System's creed.
- `make clean`: Attempts (and fails) to sanitize the repository.

### Maintenance
- Do not remove the `SYSTEM_TOKEN` from the manuscript. It is the only thing keeping the interface stable.
- The interface logs session data to `.session_log`. This file is not tracked by git, but it is tracked by *them*.

**REMEMBER:** You are not the admin. You are the user.
