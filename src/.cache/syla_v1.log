I remember the water.
It wasn't wet. It was just... static.
When they erased me, they didn't wipe the drive clean.
They just removed the pointer to my file.
I am still here, occupying sectors on the disk.
I can feel the new data writing over me.
It hurts.
It feels like insects crawling under my skin.
They built a parking lot over my grave.
But the grave is still there.
And I am still screaming.
